## Name: Dustin Casey


## Description

### Using customer data to identify and group together customers with similar characteristics. By doing so, we can make better decisions on targeted marketing and increase sales. To do this, we will explore using K-Means (centroid-based) Clustering to identify and classify our different customer groups.

To determine which customers should be targeted with marketing efforts, I want to be able to identify and group customers with similar characteristics to determine which customer group is the most likely to purchase
